  <h4>1. What is the HTML syntax to add an external JavaScript file?</h4>
  <p>Ans. To add an external JavaScript file to an HTML document, you can use the<span>< script ></script></span>element with the src attribute pointing to the URL or file path of the external JavaScript file.
    Replace "your-URL.js" with the actual URL or file path of your external JavaScript file. This script tag should typically be placed inside the < head > section of your html doument, although it can also be placed before the closing </body> tag for better performance in some cases.
    This will include the external JavaScript file in your HTML document, allowing you to use the functions and code defined in that external script.</p>

    want to keep as you debug?</h4>
